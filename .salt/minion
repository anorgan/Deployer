##### Primary configuration settings #####
##########################################
# Set the location of the salt master server, if the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
master: localhost

# Set the port used by the master reply and authentication server
#master_port: 4506

# The user to run salt
#user: root

# The root directory prepended to these options: pki_dir, cachedir, log_file.
#root_dir: /

# The directory to store the pki information in
#pki_dir: /etc/salt/pki

#####     File Directory Settings    #####
##########################################
# The Salt Minion can redirect all file server operations to a local directory,
# this allows for the same state tree that is on the master to be used if
# coppied completely onto the minion. This is a literal copy of the settings on
# the master but used to reference a local directory on the minion.

# Set the file client, the client defaults to looking on the master server for
# files, but can be directed to look at the local file directory setting
# defined below by setting it to local.
file_client: local

# The file directory works on environments passed to the minion, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:
#   base:
#     - /srv/salt/
#   dev:
#     - /srv/salt/dev/services
#     - /srv/salt/dev/states
#   prod:
#     - /srv/salt/prod/services
#     - /srv/salt/prod/states
#
# Default:
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt

# The Salt pillar is searched for locally if file_client is set to local. If
# this is the case, and pillar data is defined, then the pillar_roots need to
# also be configured on the minion:
pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt/pillar


######         Logging settings       #####
###########################################
# The location of the minion log file
#log_file: /var/log/salt/minion
#
# The level of messages to send to the log file.
# One of 'info', 'quiet', 'critical', 'error', 'debug', 'warning'.
# Default: 'warning'
#log_level: warning
#
# Logger levels can be used to tweak specific loggers logging levels.
# For example, if you want to have the salt library at the 'warning' level,
# but you still wish to have 'salt.modules' at the 'debug' level:
#   log_granular_levels: {
#     'salt': 'warning',
#     'salt.modules': 'debug'
#   }
#
#log_granular_levels: {}
